    "# Workshop: Genetic Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this workshop is to implement a genetic programming algorithm to evolve a program that can solve the Lunar Lander problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lunar Lander problem is a classic reinforcement learning problem where the objective is to land a spacecraft on the moon. The spacecraft has two engines that can be used to control the spacecraft. The engines can be turned on or off, and the thrust of each engine can be set to one of three levels: -1, 0, or 1. The spacecraft has a limited amount of fuel, and the goal is to land the spacecraft on the moon with as little fuel as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the Lunar Lander problem in this workshop, we will use the [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) library. The OpenAI Gym library provides a collection of reinforcement learning problems, including the Lunar Lander problem. The OpenAI Gym library also provides a Python interface to the Lunar Lander problem, which we will use in this workshop.\n",

    "\n",
    "To help you on how to implement the genetic programming algorithm, here are some differences between genetic algorithm and genetic programming:\n",
    "1. Genetic programming uses a tree structure to represent the solution, while genetic algorithm uses a vector of values. The numbers of values can be different for each solution in Genetic Programming, while the number of values is the same for each solution in Genetic Algorithm.\n",
    "2. The mutation operator is different. In genetic programming, the mutation operator can change the structure of the tree, while in genetic algorithm, the mutation operator can only change the values in the vector.\n"

    "3. `Fitness`: The fitness of the individual (setted while the evaluation).\n",
    "4. `Evaluate method`: The method that will evaluate the individual.\n",
    "5. `Mutate method`: The method that will mutate the individual.\n",
