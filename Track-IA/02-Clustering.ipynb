    "# Workshop: Clustering and Classification with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this workshop is to introduce you to the basics of clustering and classification with Python. We will use the [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library, which is a very popular library for machine learning in Python. We will also use the [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) library for data manipulation and the [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) library for plotting (seen in the previous workshop).\n",

    "\n",
    "For this workshop, we will use the [Iris flower data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set), which is a very famous data set in machine learning. It contains 150 samples of 3 different species of iris flowers (50 samples for each species). For each sample, 4 features are measured: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. The goal is to classify the samples into the 3 different species based on these 4 features."

Many ways of visualizing the data set are possible, but we will use a scatter plot of the data points, where each data point is represented by a dot, and the x and y coordinates of the dot are the values of the first and second features of the data point. We will use the pandas library to do this."
